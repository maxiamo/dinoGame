# dinoGame
So this game was made as my school project. In this repo there is a full code of game, so you can just copy it to, for example,
Visual Studio (this have to be C++ Console Application) and run it. As simple as that.

The project itself was made with Classes, so I hope it will help you with C++ learning or you can use it just for practicing.
